## Hey 👋
I'm Harbani, a second-year computer engineering student with a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, currently focused on building responsive and accessible web pages.
I'm already building clean interfaces using HTML and CSS, and every project teaches me something new. I'm committed to mastering the fundamentals and explore the world of tech. 
Rather than jumping into everything at once, I take a deliberate approach to learning: one concept, one project, one improvement at a time. 

---
# Current Focus
- Strengthening my understanding of HTML5 semantics and accessibility
- Learning CSS layouts, Flexbox, and basic responsive design

---
# What’s Next
- JavaScript — but only once I can make CSS *sing*  
- Small, focused open-source contributions  
- Working on real projects with people who value intent over hype

<!--# My Goals
If a stranger can read my code without a comment and know what’s going on, I’ve done my job. That’s the bar.-->
---
# What I Value
Collaborating with people who care about the “why” as much as the “how”.
